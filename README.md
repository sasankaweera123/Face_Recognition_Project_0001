# Face_Recognition_Project üë±üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüë±üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A face recognition project created using Python involves using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and identify human faces in images or videos.

## How Face Recognition works üõ†‚öôÔ∏è

- Gathering a dataset of faces - This can be done by collecting images of people's faces or by using pre-existing datasets.

- Preprocessing the images - This involves resizing the images, converting them to grayscale, and performing any necessary image enhancements.

- Detecting faces in the images - This is done using face detection algorithms like Haar cascades or deep learning-based models like OpenCV DNN or MTCNN.

- Extracting features from the faces - This step involves using deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract a set of features from the detected faces.

- Training a face recognition model - A machine learning algorithm like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is trained on the extracted features to learn how to recognize faces.

- Testing the face recognition model - The trained model is then used to identify faces in new images or videos by comparing the extracted features of the detected faces to the features learned during training.

# Packages üì¶

- [cmake](https://pypi.org/project/cmake/) : CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.

- [dlib](https://pypi.org/project/dlib/) : Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems.

- [face-recognition](https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/) : Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the world‚Äôs simplest face recognition library.

- [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) : NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

- [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) : Pre-built CPU-only OpenCV packages for Python.
