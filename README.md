# Packages

- [cmake](https://pypi.org/project/cmake/) : CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.

- [dlib](https://pypi.org/project/dlib/) : Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems.

- [face-recognition](https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/) : Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the worldâ€™s simplest face recognition library.

- [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) : NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

- [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) : Pre-built CPU-only OpenCV packages for Python.
